# Time Series Forecasting on Apple Stock using SARIMA

This project involves forecasting Apple stock prices using the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) technique. The dataset contains historical stock data of Apple from 2012 to 2019.

## Introduction
Time series forecasting is a crucial aspect of financial analysis and decision-making. In this project, we aimed to forecast the future prices of Apple stock based on historical data. SARIMA, a variation of the ARIMA model, is particularly useful for capturing the seasonal patterns and trends present in time series data.

## Dataset
The dataset contains daily stock data of Apple from January 3, 2012, to December 30, 2019. It includes features such as Date, Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume.

## Methodology
**Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, convert data types, and ensure consistency.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We explore the dataset to understand the underlying patterns, trends, and seasonalities.

**Model Training:** The SARIMA model is trained on the historical Apple stock data. The model is tuned using techniques such as grid search to find the optimal parameters.

**Forecasting:** Using the trained SARIMA model, we forecast future stock prices of Apple.
